# Covid Survival Project

A machine learning project that learns from early COVID-19 data and predicts whether you would survive or not


## Description
The Covid Survival Project was inspired by the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster project on Kaggle. By learning from early COVID-19 survival data, this project generates a decision tree of survival rates on gender and age.

## Lessons Learned

Because this was one of our first machine learning projects, there was a lot that we had to learn. Learning how to use Python's machine learning libraries on a time crunch proved challening. Another challenge we faced was finding useful data. Since COVID-19 was still developing at the time, data with useful features was hard to come by. We overcame this by intensively cleaning our dataset.
